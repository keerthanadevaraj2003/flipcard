                <p> <center>IS A GIFT THAT EVERYONE 
                FAILS TO USE!!!A common type of nature poetry is the haiku.William Wordsworth is considered one 
                of the greatest poets in English literature and he is the most famous nature poet.It consists of just three lines,
                 but this doesn't necessarily mean that it's simple. A haiku is an expression of an
                 observation or an experience in a brief moment of time. It's generally a nature poem and 
                 often includes vivid imagery.</center>
